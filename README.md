# ASGCN(0.0)
## About
The dataset and source code of "Learning Aligned-Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph Classification",
published at ECML-PKDD 2019.
## Dataset
Preprocessed data, i.e., Grid Structure
### Description
'''GA_XXXf.mat''': Adjacency Matrix Tensor, shape like \[Batch, N, N\]               
'''GF_XXXf.mat''': Node Feature Tensor, shape like \[Batch, N, C\]               
'''GL_XXXf.mat''': Graph Label Tensor, shape like \[Batch, M\]        

N denotes the number of nodes in the Aligned Structure, C denotes the dimension of Node Feature, M denotes the number of graph labels.
## NOTE:
Source code about Grid Structure and ASGCN(Graph Convolutional Networks) be released soon.
