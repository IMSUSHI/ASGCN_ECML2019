# ASGCN(0.0)
## About
The dataset and source code of "Learning Aligned-Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph Classification",
published at ECML-PKDD 2019.
## Dataset
Preprocessed data, i.e., Grid Structure
GA_XXXf.mat: Adjacency Matrix Tensor, shape like \[Batch, N, N\](N denotes the number of nodes in the Aligned Structure)
GF_XXXf.mat:
GL_XXXf.mat:
## NOTE:
Source code about Grid Structure and ASGCN(Graph Convolutional Networks) be released soon.
